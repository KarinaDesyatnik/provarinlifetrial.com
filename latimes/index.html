<p><b>The Inside Story on Great Sex!</b><br>
This month I got a letter from a reader in Texas about a “little secret’’ that’s made her sex life with her husband absolutely explosive. (Those Texas women tell it like it is.)</p>
<p><b>Tina writes:</b> Dear Karen,</p>

<p>For years my husband and I had a great love life, but when he reached his 50s, he started to struggle in the bedroom. The few times we did have sex, his erection was definitely softer, leaving us both unsatisfied. He tried every product available, but nothing worked. I know this is terrible, but I found myself thinking ‘’My strong, passionate husband has become a sexual weakling.’’ I had no idea it would all turn around in just 3 weeks!</p>

<p>Last month he came home from a business trip in Europe and shocked me with more energy and passion than he’s had in years. Hard as a rock, he tossed me around the bedroom like we were newlyweds and gave me a night I’ll never forget - It was incredible! He flat wore me out that night and it’s been like that ever since. His erections are so hard and powerful, they spark the most intense, toe-curling ‘moments’ I’ve ever had! So here we are, enjoying the best sex of our lives… in our late-50’s!</p>

<p>On his trip, my husband stayed next to an Italian nutritionist and his wife, and heard them making loud, passionate love every single night. One afternoon, my husband asked the man his secret. The nutritionist smiled and said that he’s 78 years old and after 42 years together, their sex life was better than ever. Then he pulled a small pack of tablets from his satchel, gave it to my husband, and said ‘’These come from a small village north of my town. They’re made from naturally pure plant extracts, packed with densely rich sexual nutrients. They will give you a strong desire for sex, very hard erections, and a climax like you’ve never felt before.’’ Then he laughed and said, “You’ll become an Italian Stallion like me!”</p>

<p>Karen, Italian Stallion is right! But now the pack is almost empty and we both desperately want more. Do you know about these European sex tablets and how to get some in the States?</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br>Tina D., Fort Worth, TX</p>

<p>Tina, you’re in luck. Ever wonder why older men from Italy and all over Europe are famous for staying energized and sexually passionate well into their 80’s? For years, these men have relied on a unique blossom seed extract to enhance their sexual power and performance.</p>

<p>Milled on the fertile northern plains, and sold under the name Provarin, these pure plant extracts have a legendary reputation throughout Europe for naturally fueling extremely hard erections. As Giovanni from Milan put it, “It’s like bedroom rocket fuel - especially for us older guys!”</p>

<p>The best part from a woman’s perspective is the extreme hardness and on-going power is enough to send us over the blissful edge! I found out about Provarin a few years ago when I was dating a cowboy from Wyoming. He took Provarin every morning and believe me, that good ol’ boy sure rocked my nights!</p>

<p>All-natural and safe to take, Provarin is a well-kept secret for those in the know. An old-school, family business, they still harvest product by hand and don’t do any advertising. They don’t need to. Long-time customers and word of mouth ensures their limited stock is sold out every year.</p>

<p>They recently put a distributor here in the U.S. and a spokesman told me they are proud to produce the highest quality product for men and couples. He went on to say that if any of my readers call today and mention this article, they’ll be offered an additional one-time 50% discount, plus 30 free bonus tablets, and their order will be processed and shipped free - today!</p>

<p>So, there you go, Tina - and the rest of you readers! Just give them a call today and mention this article.<br> The number is <a href="tel:8779228811" style="color:#000;"><b>(877) 922-8811</b></a></p>

<p>Aren’t you glad you asked?</p>
